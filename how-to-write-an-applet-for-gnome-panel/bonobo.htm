<h2>Bonobo</h2>
Bonobo is a component model for creating reusable software components and compound documents.
<br />
Components can be written in different languages and run on top of different runtimes;
<br />
they need only adhere to an interface specified with the Interface Definition Language (IDL).
<br />
Bonobo helps fill the gaps in CORBA, providing the additional interfaces and specifications needed to support consistent components.

<h2>Corba</h2>

<br />
Bonobo is based on the CORBA architecture. 
<br />
Bonobo is built off of CORBA, allowing components to run in seperate processes.
<br />
CORBA's flexible design even allows components to run on seperate machines over a network.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Using Bonobo enables the applets to communicate effectively with the panel, affording users a consistent interface.
<br />
You may wish to use Bonobo to provide complex graphical components that can be embedded into applications. 

<h2>ORBit</h2>
ORBit, GNOME's CORBA implementation.
<br />
GNOME provides its own fast and lightweight CORBA implementation with ORBit.
<br />
ORBit is an incredibly fast CORBA implementation.
<br />
Although you will rarely need to use CORBA without Bonobo, it can be used directly.
<br />
For instance, GNOME's accessibility infastructure uses CORBA 
to allow assistive tools to inspect and interact with running applications.

<h2>Deprecation</h2>
The GNOME release has officially deprecated Bonobo sometime since GNOME 2.4
<br />
Bonobo, libIDL and ORBit have been deprecated in favor of D-Bus and other technologies.
<br />
Developers have been advised to use or switch to an alternative such as D-Bus
<br />
For most IPC needs, however, GNOME is moving towards D-Bus, as integrating D-Bus into applications is considerably easier.
<br />
<br />
MATE 1.6 removes some deprecated libraries, moving from mate-conf (a fork of GConf) to GSettings,
and from mate-corba (a fork of GNOME's Bonobo) to D-Bus.
<br />
Migrate from dbus-glib to GDBus
